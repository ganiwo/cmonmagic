### Official afterparty and afterafterparty :p

This year, the official afterparty starts earlier and closer to the venue! You can sit down at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rwfNa3W2CLFnVdZj9" target="_blank">Emcek (click for Google Maps)</a> starting at 6:00pm (near the main entrance to the event). There will be snacks waiting for you and you will be able to grab some drinks and watch the stream of our Top8 on a big screen.

We could sit there until late at night... but to make sure it doesn't get boring, around 9:30pm we're moving to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vNiCTprMzYkBt5ga9" target="_blank">Upojeni Multitap (click for Google Maps)</a> located right by the market square. Top8 stream will continue as well as good food and various drinks (including a special offer of shots prepared exclusively for us)!

#### Tickets available until Thursday, September 26th!
