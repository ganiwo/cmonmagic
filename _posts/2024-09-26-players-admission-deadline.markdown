### Player admission meeting details

<a href="https://cmonmagic.pl/images/cmonkato24infoen.pdf" target="_blank">Download info pack in PDF</a>

Players - C'mon! Katowice 2024 is hosted during the "Plansz√≥wki w Spodku 2024" convention that expects several thousands of visitors. To streamline the tournament operations we require everyone without exceptions to be present for one-time player admission to the event venue as described in the downloadable info pack. You won't be able to pass your clearance at a random gate and therefore we ask you to shop up timely. Once you receieve your clearance and wristband, you will be able leave and re-enter the venue during its regular opening hours. DO NOT REMOVE your wristbands during the weekend. They are waterproof.

You will be admitted based on your registration to the tournament. You do not need any proof of purchase as it is going to be checked during admission. You may be asked to present your ID to tournament staff for identification purposes.

#### No late admissions guaranteed

Please note that due to the event logistics we do not guarantee late admissions. Not showing up on time for your first round may result in game or match loss.
