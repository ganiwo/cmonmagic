Series started back in 2020 as a community driven event and quickly became well known across the country thanks to the efforts put in by Pauper Polska Discord community, tournament organizers and live stream. First tournament (known as Pauper@Spodek back then) was held in February 2020. Since then we have visited Katowice, Poznań, Cracow and Warsaw. With 8 events under our belt C'mon! is growing year after year and we are rapidly approaching the limits as we define them today capped at 128 players. Community behind Pauper@Spodek is inspired with the growth of the event and is happy to invite you to experience it for yourself!

### Sponsorship Opportunities

We are open for partnerships to provide players with additional prizes and products. There are several options available based on the level of commitment you would be willing to consider, so please get in touch for arrangements.

### Media Partnership

We are very happy to invite all media to partner with us to spread the information about these tournaments! We will be very happy to name you our partner, share the information with you and welcome your staff at the event for any additional press coverage as agreed between parties.
